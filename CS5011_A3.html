<p>
   </p>

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.1   </span> <a
 id="x1-50003.1"></a>Background</h4>
<p>The Tornado sweeper game is inspired by the well-known Minesweeper computer
game<span class="footnote-mark"><a
href="main2.html#fn1x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a
 id="x1-5001f1"></a> .
A Tornado sweeper world is a grid in the shape of a rhombus with
<!--l. 53--><math
 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"
display="inline" ><mi
>N</mi></math> cells per side, where each
cell is of hexagonal shape. <!--l. 53--><math
 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"
display="inline" ><mi
>T</mi></math>
tornadoes are scattered among the cells. The rules of the Tornado
sweeper game are similar to those of Minesweeper, played on a hexagonal
board<span class="footnote-mark"><a
href="main3.html#fn2x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a
 id="x1-5002f2"></a> ,
but the Tornado worlds are a small subset of those. A logical agent playing the Tornado Sweeper game
aims to uncover all cells on the board but those containing a Tornado. If the agent probes a cell that
contains a Tornado, the game is over. Otherwise, a clue appears on the cell indicating the
number of Tornadoes in the 6 adjacent neighbours of the probed cell. In this practical,
your aim is to develop logic-based strategies for an agent to solve the tornado sweeper
game.
   </p>

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.2   </span> <a
 id="x1-60003.2"></a>The board</h4>
<p>Each Tornado world is represented as an array of characters, where each character represents an
hexagonal cell with the following code: </p>

</li></ul>
<p>Each hexagonal cell is represented with its coordinates

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.3   </span> <a

<p>   Your task is to implement logic agents that play the game. In addition to the game rules, you
agent should adhere to the following principles.
     </p>
<dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">

<p>   There are a number of possible reasoning strategies that the agent can employ, the agent goal is to
employ one that limits the amount of guesswork probing needed to solve the game, in order to
increase the chances of winning. For more details on the strategies, please refer to the lecture
slides.
</p>
<p>
   </p>

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4   </span> <a
 id="x1-80004"></a>The tasks</h3>
<p>The task for Part 1 is to implement a basic Tornado Sweeper agent by probing cells in order.
The main objective of this part is to ensure that you are familiar with the rules of the
Tornado Sweeper game, and are able to print the output in the required format (See Section
<a
href="#x1-140004.6">4.6<!--tex4ht:ref: sec: output --></a>).
</p>
<p>   For Parts 2 to 4, your task is to investigate how far the different strategies will get you in the given
Tornado Sweeper worlds. The logical agent can only flag or probe cells that are proven to contain or
not contain a tornado. Hence, with correct implementation, the agent should never lose the
game, but may arrive at a situation where the game is not won but the strategy(-ies) no
longer yields any logical conclusion that a cell could be flagged or probed. Your task is
to find this situation in each of the worlds provided and output the agent’s view at this
point.
</p>
<p>
   </p>

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.1   </span> <a
 id="x1-90004.1"></a>Part 1 - Basic Tornado Sweeper Agent</h4>
<p>A basic Tornado Sweeper agent is one that can play the Tornado Sweeper game by only probing cells
on the board. You are required to write a program that takes any of the Tornado Sweeper worlds
provided and permits an agent to play the game by probing the cells in order. The agent should
hold a knowledge base indicating the cells that are yet to be probed, and the information
about the cells already probed. The agent’s view of the world should be clearly distinct
from the board representing the world. In addition, the agent should be able to probe
non-blocked covered cells <strong><span
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">in order</span></strong> (left to right on each row; top row to bottom row. So the


<!--l. 121--><math
 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"
display="inline" ><mo
class="MathClass-open" stretchy="false">[</mo><mi
>x</mi><mo
class="MathClass-punc">,</mo><mi
>y</mi><mo
class="MathClass-close" stretchy="false">]</mo></math>
coordinates are in lexicographical order), receive and process the information contained in that cell.
The agent should also be able to establish whether the game is over.
</p>
<p>
   </p>

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.2   </span> <a
 id="x1-100004.2"></a>Part 2 - Beginner Tornado Sweeper Agent</h4>
<p>A beginner Tornado Sweeper agent is one that is able to flag potential tornadoes to avoid a losing,
taking into consideration the knowledge acquired so far. Instead of probing in order, this agent
plays the Tornado Sweeper game using the single point reasoning strategy (SPS) from
lectures, adapted for the Tornado Sweeper game. You may probe or flag the cells in any
order you like, but you may only probe or flag cells that are proven to be safe or unsafe.
As mentioned before, your task is to find the situation where the the strategy ceases to
provide any more logical information, and print the agent’s view at this point (see Section
<a
href="#x1-140004.6">4.6<!--tex4ht:ref: sec: output --></a>).
</p>
<p>
   </p>

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.3   </span> <a
 id="x1-110004.3"></a>Part 3 - Intermediate Tornado Sweeper Agent</h4>
<p>An intermediate Tornado Sweeper agent plays the Tornado Sweeper game using the satisfiability test
reasoning strategy (SATS) from lectures, adapted for Tornado Sweeper game, in addition to the
SPS. The agent should be able to transform its current partial view of the world into a
logic sentence, and use satisfiability results to select the next move. For this part, you
should use the “DNF encoding” from lectures to write the logic sentences. The library
LogicNG<span class="footnote-mark"><a
href="main4.html#fn3x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">3</sup></a></span><a
 id="x1-11001f3"></a>
should be used to prove that a given cell does or does not contain a tornado. As in Part 2, your
program should stop when no other deduction could be made on whether a cell is safe or
not.
   </p>

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.4   </span> <a
 id="x1-120004.4"></a>Part 4 - Intermediate Tornado Sweeper Agent 2</h4>
<p>As in Part 3, the agent in this part also uses the SPS and SATS to play the Tornado Sweeper game.
However, you should write your logic sentence directly in conjunctive normal form, transform your
sentence into DIMACS format, before feeding it into a SAT solver. For this part, you should use the
“CNF encoding” from lectures to write the logic sentences, and you should use SAT4J
Core<span class="footnote-mark"><a
href="main5.html#fn4x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">4</sup></a></span><a
 id="x1-12001f4"></a>
to solve the satisfiability problems. Note that you are <strong><span
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">not</span></strong> allowed to use LogicNG for this part of the
practical, nor are you allowed to use other libraries or own code that transforms logical sentences into
conjunctive normal form. If done correctly, the final agent’s view should be the same as
that of Part 3. In addition, you should compare and contrast these two encodings in your
report.


   </p>

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.5   </span> <a
 id="x1-130004.5"></a>Part 5 - Additional Advanced Logical Agent</h4>
<p>It is strongly recommended that you ensure you have completed the requirements for previous parts
before attempting any of these additional requirements. You may consider one or two additional
functionalities:
     </p>
<dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   1. </dt><dd
class="enumerate-enumitem">Suggest  an  additional  strategy  to  improve  the  performance  of  the  logic  agent  (some
     inspiration may be drawn from the minesweeper wiki<span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x1-13002f5"></a> ).
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   2. </dt><dd
class="enumerate-enumitem">Implement and compare other methods of encoding the knowledge base (for example other

 id="x1-13004f6"></a> ).
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   3. </dt><dd
class="enumerate-enumitem">Include additional items or rules in the game, write the rules for these items and extend
     the implementation of the game to include these new rules (some inspiration may be

   4. </dt><dd
class="enumerate-enumitem">Permit the agent to play on boards of a different shape (e.g. triangular or square).
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">

     the complexity of the game and extend your reasoning strategies to guide the agent to solve
     the problem, or identify additional games that can be solved with similar logic strategies.</dd></dl>
<p>   You need to test your extension extensively and provide testing evidence in the report. In
other words, you need to convince and prove to the marker your extensions are correct and
therefore worth the extra credit. Without sufficient evidence of testing, extensions will be
ignored.
</p>
<p>
   </p>

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.6   </span> <a
 id="x1-140004.6"></a>The output</h4>
<p>Your program should output the agent’s view at the end of the game. So, for Part 1, that
is the situation where you have won or lost the game, whereas in Parts 2 to 4, it is the
situation where your strategy <em><span
class="cmti-10x-x-109">does not yield any more logical moves</span></em>. Note that even if the
game has been won, the agent should still flag the cells that could be deduced to contain
tornadoes.
</p>
<p>   An agent’s view is a map with the following as keys: </p>

     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">
     <p><span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">’?’</span></span></span> to mean that the cell covered,
     </p>
</li>
     <li class="itemize">
     <p><span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">’*’</span></span></span> to mean that the cell is flagged for a tornado,


     </p>
</li>
     <li class="itemize">
     <p><span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">’0’</span></span></span>–<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">’6’</span></span></span> to mean the probed cells not containing tornadoes, with the number is number
     of tornadoes in the neighbouring cells on the underlying map.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>   Your program should also output the result of the game, i.e. game lost, game won or no other
logical moves (see starter code for the exact wordings).
</p>
<p>   In addition to that, your program should also allow an additional parameter. If set to <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">verbose</span></span></span>, the
agent’s view at each step should be printed. Otherwise, your program should only output
the final agent’s view. Sample code to do these is provided in the starter code and you
are also given some sample output to check if you meet these requirements (see Section
<a
href="#x1-190005.4">5.4<!--tex4ht:ref: sec: autotest --></a>).

href="#x1-60011">1<!--tex4ht:ref: map --></a> correspond to the
indices of the two dimensional char array given in the starter code. You are free to use this starter
code as is or you may modify it, however, please ensure that you do not change the worlds to be tested


(you may include additional ones), and that the outputs are formatted in the same way as
demonstrated in <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">A3main.java</span></span></span>.
</p>
<p>   You are also given a simple script <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">playSweeper.sh</span></span></span> that includes the libraries, compile and run
your program. The script will be used to support automated checking (see Section <a
href="#x1-190005.4">5.4<!--tex4ht:ref: sec: autotest --></a>). Please ensure
that you edit this file to include any other libraries you are using.
   </p>

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.3   </span> <a
 id="x1-180005.3"></a>Running</h4>
<p>Your code should run using the following command:
</p>
<p>   <pre>
<span
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">./playSweeper.sh</span><span
class="cmtt-10x-x-109"> &#x003C;P1|P2|P3|P4&#x003E;</span><span
class="cmtt-10x-x-109"> &#x003C;ID&#x003E;</span><span
class="cmtt-10x-x-109"> [verbose]</span><span
class="cmtt-10x-x-109"> [&#x003C;any</span><span
class="cmtt-10x-x-109"> other</span><span
class="cmtt-10x-x-109"> param&#x003E;]</span>
</p>
<p></pre>where ID is the world name. For example, to run an agent of Part 1 on the board in Figure <a
href="#x1-60011">1<!--tex4ht:ref: map --></a> where the
agent’s view after each action is displayed, we use: <pre>
<span
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">./playSweeper.sh</span><span
class="cmtt-10x-x-109"> P1</span><span
class="cmtt-10x-x-109"> TEST1</span><span
class="cmtt-10x-x-109"> verbose</span>
</p>
<p></pre>As another example, to run the intermediate agent of Part 3 on the world named <code><span
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">TEST2</span></code> without the
verbose option we use: <pre>
<span
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">./playSweeper.sh</span><span
class="cmtt-10x-x-109"> P3</span><span
class="cmtt-10x-x-109"> TEST2</span>
</p>
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>   For Part 1 and the non-verbose version of Parts 2 – 4, the output of the system must be as
described as we will perform some automatic tests on the required output. For advanced agent
functionalities (Part 5), please include clear running instructions.
</p>
<p>
   </p>

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.4   </span> <a
 id="x1-190005.4"></a>Automatic Testing</h4>
<p>We provide some stacscheck tests to help you check that your output is structured with the required
format. The tests only check the 3 by 3 boards <code><span
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">TEST1</span></code> – <code><span
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">TEST6</span></code>, for Part 1 and the non-verbose version
of Part 2. They can be found at <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">/cs/studres/CS5011/Practicals/A3/Tests</span></span></span> and can be run with
<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">stacscheck</span></span></span>.
</p>
<p>   In order to run the automated checker on your program, place your program in a directory in the
School lab machines, ssh into one of the School computers running Linux if you are working remotely,
then change directory to your CS5011 A3 directory and execute the following command:
</p>

<div class="center"
>
<p>
</p>
<p><pre>

class="cmtt-10x-x-109">stacscheck</span><span
class="cmtt-10x-x-109"> /cs/studres/CS5011/Coursework/A3/Tests/</span>
</p>
<p></pre></p>
</div>
<p>   Please note that these tests are not designed to check that your program works correctly, please do
test your system well and provide information on your own testing in the report.
